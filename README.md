# CLI Client/Server example

Instructions

This is an example code on how to execute commands capturing from one esp32 on another esp32 over a raw tcp socket. We redirect the stdout and stdin to the socket, and this enables us to run on that session.

TODO:
   Add proper TELNET signaling so we are telnet compatible. Then we have a telnet client/server
